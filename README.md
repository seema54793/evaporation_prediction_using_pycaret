# evaporation_prediction_using_pycaret
PyCaret is an open-source, low-code machine learning library in Python that automates machine learning workflows. It is an end-to-end machine learning and model management tool that speeds up the experiment cycle exponentially and makes you more productive.

PyCaret for Machine Learning.
PyCaret is used for:
 ~Classification
 ~Regression
 ~Clustering
 
Steps involved in this project:
~ Loading the Data via Pandas library
~ Cleaning the Data
~ Setting up the Environment, (and spliting the data into 80% training and 20% testing.)
~ Creating the model(regression)
~ Tune the model (automatically tune the hyperparameters of a regression model)
~ Ploting various model (analyze model performance using various plots)
~ Finalizing the model (by analysing the model with best value of r_square and RMSE score)
~ Predicting the model (make prediction on new / unseen data)
~ Saving or loading the model for future use.
